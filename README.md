# Improved Detection of Fraud Cases for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

This project aims to create accurate and strong fraud detection models that handle the unique challenges of both types of transaction data. It also includes using geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition to improve detection. Good fraud detection greatly improves transaction security. By using advanced machine learning models and detailed data analysis, Adey Innovations Inc. can spot fraudulent activities more accurately. This helps prevent financial losses and builds trust with customers and financial institutions.

A key challenge in fraud detection is managing the trade-off between security and user experience. False positives (incorrectly flagging legitimate transactions) can alienate customers, while false negatives (missing actual fraud) lead to direct financial loss. Your models should therefore be evaluated not just on overall accuracy, but on their ability to balance these competing costs. A well-designed fraud detection system also makes real-time monitoring and reporting more efficient, allowing businesses to act quickly and reduce risks.

This project will involve:

*   Analyzing and preprocessing transaction data.
*   Creating and engineering features that help identify fraud patterns.
*   Building and training machine learning models to detect fraud.
*   Evaluating model performance and making a justified selection..
*   Interpreting your model's decisions using modern explainability techniques.

## Data and Features

You will be using the following datasets:

### Fraud_Data.csv

Includes e-commerce transaction data aimed at identifying fraudulent activities.

*   **user_id**: A unique identifier for the user who made the transaction.
*   **signup_time**: The timestamp when the user signed up.
*   **purchase_time**: The timestamp when the purchase was made.
*   **purchase_value**: The value of the purchase in dollars.
*   **device_id**: A unique identifier for the device used to make the transaction.
*   **source**: The source through which the user came to the site (e.g., SEO, Ads).
*   **browser**: The browser used to make the transaction (e.g., Chrome, Safari).
*   **sex**: The gender of the user (M for male, F for female).
*   **age**: The age of the user.
*   **ip_address**: The IP address from which the transaction was made.
*   **class**: The target variable where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a non-fraudulent transaction.

**Critical Challenge**: Class Imbalance. This dataset is highly imbalanced, with far fewer fraudulent transactions than legitimate ones. This will significantly influence your choice of evaluation metrics and modeling techniques.

### IpAddress_to_Country.csv

Maps IP addresses to countries

*   **lower_bound_ip_address**: The lower bound of the IP address range.
*   **upper_bound_ip_address**: The upper bound of the IP address range.
*   **country**: The country corresponding to the IP address range.

### creditcard.csv

Contains bank transaction data specifically curated for fraud detection analysis.

*   **Time**: The number of seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
*   **V1 to V28**: These are anonymized features resulting from a PCA transformation. Their exact nature is not disclosed for privacy reasons, but they represent the underlying patterns in the data.
*   **Amount**: The transaction amount in dollars.
*   **Class**: The target variable, where 1 indicates a fraudulent transaction and 0 indicates a non-fraudulent transaction.

**Critical Challenge**: Class Imbalance. Like the e-commerce data, this dataset is extremely imbalanced, which is typical for fraud detection problems.
